# Azure IoT SDKs for Node.js code samples

The code samples in this folder are not associated with any particular tutorial or quick-start guide. They are designed to illustrate as simply as possible the usage of an API.

- The `device` folder contains samples for code running on devices connecting to an Azure IoT hub or an Azure IoT Edge hub, either as a simple *device*, or as a *module*.
- The `service` folder contains samples demonstrating the use of the service-side APIs, that can be used to manage device identities, twins, configurations, etc as well as communicate with devices from a custom service connected to an Azure IoT hub.
